Notes:
To generate experiment results, run the Assignment1.py python script, using python that 
has the required virtual environment from the textbook. Otherwise, edits to
specific portions of code will need to be made to specify "float_()" to "float64()" in 
the Adaline1.py, adaline.py, perceptron.py, and perceptron_b2w.py
