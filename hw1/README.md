Notes:
To generate experiment results, run the Assignment1.py python script, using python that 
has the required virtual environment from the list seen below. Otherwise, edits to
specific portions of code will need to be made to specify "float_()" to "float64()" in 
the Adaline_T4.py, adaline.py, perceptron.py, and perceptron_b2w.py python scripts.  

A few other libraries are in use for assignment 2 that are in this list, but not used
in assignment 1.  

The list is as follows:  
numpy==2.1.1  
pandas==3.0.0

Please contact Matthew Macias @ Mattzylm@unm.edu or matthew.macias@cosmiac.org if
